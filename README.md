# KHANDLE-practice-effects
This repository contains the code for Chen et al's paper titled "Pragmatic Approaches to Handling Practice Effects in Longitudinal Cognitive Aging Research" (https://alz-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1002/alz.13067). Below is a brief description of the code files included in this repository:

01_run_all.R: This file runs all the necessary code for conducting the analyses related to Practice Effects.

01_make_df.R: This file contains code that cleans up the data from KHANDLE, STAR, and LA90 datasets, and generates the analytical sample required for the analysis.

02_fits_model.R: This file includes code for fitting the models to estimate Practice Effects. It also includes code for fitting linear mixed models, both with and without forcing Practice Effects.

03_table1.R: This file consists of code for creating Table 1, as mentioned in the paper.

If you have any questions or need further clarification on the code, please feel free to contact Dr.Ruijia Chen (ruijia.chen@ucsf.edu).
